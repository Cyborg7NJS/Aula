            <h2>What are Urban Heat Islands?</h2>
            <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that are significantly warmer than their surrounding rural
                areas. This phenomenon occurs due to the concentration of structures and energy use in cities, leading
                to increased temperatures compared to less developed regions.</p>

            <h2>What is our Technology?</h2>
            <p>Our technology is based in a Rainy Drone that uses one AI sensor to monitor the Urban Heat Islands and
                simplely rain in some hot areas and to help for the grown of green areas.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of addressing urban heat islands</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving public health by reducing respiratory diseases and heat stress</li>
                <li>Reducing energy consumption in urban areas</li>

            <h2>Example: São Paulo</h2>
            <p>São Paulo is addressing heat islands through initiatives like increasing green areas and green roof
                projects.</p>
                <p>These efforts aim to mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve the quality of life for
                its residents.</p>
